# life-searching-remote-controlled-vehicle
The life searching remote controlled vehicle (LSRCV) was created for NYIT's senior design class project. It's controlled via bluetooth and the camera feed can be accessed through wifi. The vehicle has two flaps on its sides controlled by stepper motors which allows it to navigate through a debris and its continuous track allows for good traction on the terrain surface. 
Below is an image of the assembled vehicle
